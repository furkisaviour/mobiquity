1.First of all, Basic Selenium Cucumber Hybrid(BDD+DDT) framework model was preferred in this project, which was built from scratch.

2.It was Developed with Cucumber and written step definitions using Gherkin language

3.POM (Page Object Model) pattern design with Java, Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber Framework.

4.When writing test scenarios.I determine possible actions to objects.I tied to a minimum of one Requirement or User Story.I avoided creating overly complex Test Scenarios

5.For the next step of my project I have to develop test cases. For now, I need to use my framework, which offers parallel testing, more effectively on virtual machines. I have to look at the new features coming to Selenium 4.0 and work in accordance with the updates.

See you at the next stage
